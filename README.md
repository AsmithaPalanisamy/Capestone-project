# Capestone-project
This is my capstone project from the IBM Data Analyst course. In each analytics process, the data is stored in the Jupyter notebooks that are uploaded. Week 1 in the project is data collection; 2 is data wrangling, 3 is exploratory data analysis, 4 is Data visualisation, 5 is Building a dashboard and the last week is Presentation of findings.
